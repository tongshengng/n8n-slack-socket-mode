This is an n8n community node that enables real-time Slack event processing using Socket Mode with an intelligent publish-subscribe pattern. It allows you to listen to Slack events in real-time without requiring public URLs for webhooks, making it perfect for local development and secure environments.

**Key Features:**
- 🚀 **Real-time event processing** via Slack Socket Mode
- 🔄 **Intelligent pub-sub pattern** prevents message loss with multiple connections
- 🛡️ **No webhook URLs required** - perfect for local development and secure environments
- ⚡ **Connection pooling** for optimal resource usage
- 🎯 **Advanced filtering** with regex pattern matching
- 📱 **Multiple event types** - messages, mentions, reactions, and more

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Installation

### Community Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation.

### Manual Installation

Using Bun (recommended):
```bash
bun add @ngtongsheng/n8n-nodes-slack-socket-mode-pubsub-trigger
```

Using npm:
```bash
npm install @ngtongsheng/n8n-nodes-slack-socket-mode-pubsub-trigger
```

Using pnpm:
```bash
pnpm add @ngtongsheng/n8n-nodes-slack-socket-mode-pubsub-trigger
```

After installation, restart n8n and the "Slack Socket Mode Trigger" node will be available in the trigger nodes section.

## Slack App Setup

Before using this node, you need to create a Slack app with Socket Mode enabled:

1. **Create a Slack App**
   - Go to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
   - Click "Create New App" → "From scratch"
   - Enter your app name and select your workspace

2. **Enable Socket Mode**
   - Navigate to "Socket Mode" in the left sidebar
   - Toggle "Enable Socket Mode" to ON
   - Generate an "App-Level Token" with the `connections:write` scope
   - Save the token (starts with `xapp-`)

3. **Configure OAuth & Permissions**
   - Go to "OAuth & Permissions" in the left sidebar
   - Add the following Bot Token Scopes:
     - `app_mentions:read` - To receive app mentions
     - `channels:history` - To read message history
     - `channels:read` - To access channel information
     - `chat:write` - To send messages (if needed for responses)
     - `reactions:read` - To read emoji reactions
     - `team:read` - To access workspace information
   - Install the app to your workspace
   - Copy the "Bot User OAuth Token" (starts with `xoxb-`)

4. **Get Signing Secret**
   - Go to "Basic Information" in the left sidebar
   - Copy the "Signing Secret" from the App Credentials section

5. **Configure Event Subscriptions**
   - Go to "Event Subscriptions" in the left sidebar
   - Enable "Socket Mode" (should already be enabled)
   - Subscribe to bot events you want to listen to:
     - `app_mention` - When your bot is mentioned
     - `message.channels` - Messages in public channels
     - `message.groups` - Messages in private channels
     - `reaction_added` - When reactions are added to messages

## Credentials

Create a new credential of type "Slack Socket Mode Credential" with:

- **Signing Secret**: Your Slack App Signing Secret from Basic Information
- **Bot User OAuth Token**: Your Bot User OAuth Token (starts with `xoxb-`)
- **App-Level Token**: Your App-Level Token for Socket Mode (starts with `xapp-`)

## Node Configuration

The Slack Socket Mode Trigger node provides the following configuration options:

### Trigger Events
- **Message**: Triggers when messages are sent to channels
- **App Mention**: Triggers when your bot is mentioned (@your_bot_name)
- **Reaction Added**: Triggers when emoji reactions are added to messages

### Channel Filtering
- **Channels to Watch**: Select specific channels to monitor
- If no channels are selected, all accessible channels will be monitored
- Supports both public and private channels (based on bot permissions)

### Message Filtering (Message events only)
- **Message Filter**: Optional regex pattern to filter messages
- **Allow Bot Messages**: Include/exclude messages from bots and message updates
- By default, bot messages and message changes are filtered out

## Supported Events

### Message Events
- Triggers on new messages in monitored channels
- Supports regex pattern matching for content filtering
- Option to include/exclude bot messages
- Filters out message updates and changes by default

### App Mention Events
- Triggers when your bot is mentioned in any message
- Works across all channels where the bot has access
- Includes the full message context and mention details

### Reaction Added Events
- Triggers when emoji reactions are added to messages
- Provides reaction details including emoji type and user
- Works on messages in monitored channels

## Advanced Features

### Intelligent Connection Management
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses Socket Mode connections across multiple workflow instances
- **Pub-Sub Pattern**: Prevents message loss when multiple workflows use the same bot token
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes unused connections when workflows are deactivated
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with automatic reconnection

### Why Pub-Sub Pattern?
When multiple Socket Mode connections are established with the same bot token, Slack distributes events across connections in a round-robin fashion. This means:
- ❌ **Without pub-sub**: 3 workflows = 3 connections = each receives only ~33% of messages
- ✅ **With pub-sub**: 3 workflows = 1 shared connection = all workflows receive 100% of messages

The pub-sub pattern ensures **guaranteed message delivery** to all subscribers while optimizing resource usage.

### Performance Optimizations
- **Regex Caching**: Compiled regex patterns are cached for better performance
- **Event Filtering**: Early filtering at the Socket Mode level reduces processing overhead
- **Subscriber Pattern**: Efficient pub-sub pattern for handling multiple workflow triggers

### Channel Management
- **Dynamic Channel Loading**: Automatically fetches available channels for selection
- **Permission Awareness**: Only shows channels the bot has access to
- **Real-time Updates**: Reflects current channel permissions and availability

## Usage Examples

### 1. Auto-Responder Bot
```
[Slack Socket Mode Trigger] → [Switch] → [Slack]
```
- **Trigger**: Message events with regex pattern `help|support`
- **Switch**: Route based on message content
- **Slack**: Send appropriate help responses

### 2. Mention Handler
```
[Slack Socket Mode Trigger] → [HTTP Request] → [Slack]
```
- **Trigger**: App mention events
- **HTTP Request**: Fetch data from external API
- **Slack**: Reply with fetched information

### 3. Reaction Monitor
```
[Slack Socket Mode Trigger] → [Code] → [Database]
```
- **Trigger**: Reaction added events
- **Code**: Process reaction data
- **Database**: Store reaction analytics

### 4. Channel-Specific Automation
```
[Slack Socket Mode Trigger] → [IF] → [Multiple Actions]
```
- **Trigger**: Messages in specific channels only
- **IF**: Check message content or user
- **Actions**: Perform different actions based on conditions
